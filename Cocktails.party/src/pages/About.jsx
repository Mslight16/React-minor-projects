       <span>Our Story </span><br/> Cocktail Gallery was born from a passion for flavors, creativity, and storytelling. What started as a simple love for beautifully crafted drinks evolved into a platform dedicated to highlighting the artistry behind every cocktail.
        Each drink tells a story — of its origin, its ingredients, and the hands that created it. Our goal is to capture those stories and present them in a visually rich and informative way.
